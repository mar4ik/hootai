# Google Authentication Redirect Fix

## Problem Solved
When logging in via Google on `localhost`, users were being redirected to the production URL instead of staying on the local environment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Environment Configuration Module
Created a new `env-config.ts` module that:
- Provides environment-specific URLs and configurations
- Detects the current environment (development vs. production)
- Manages environment information in localStorage
- Provides helper functions for authentication flows

### 2. Updated Google Sign-in Logic
- Now uses environment-aware callback URLs
- Stores environment information for use during the callback
- Uses consistent configuration across sign-in and sign-up pages
- Properly handles redirects based on the detected environment

### 3. Improved Login Callback Handling
- Uses the environment configuration to determine the correct redirect URL
- Simplified redirect logic to use the environment-aware helper functions
- Maintains the aggressive redirect detection for development environments

### 4. Added Environment Configuration
- Updated `next.config.js` with default environment variables
- Created documentation for setting up environment variables
- Ensured the application is environment-aware in both development and production

## How It Works Now

1. **Sign-in Initiation:**
   - The application detects whether it's running in development or production
   - It stores this information in localStorage
   - It generates the appropriate callback URL based on the environment

2. **During Authentication:**
   - Google OAuth completes and redirects to the callback URL
   - The callback page checks if it's in the correct environment
   - If not (e.g., redirected to production when it should be localhost), it redirects back

3. **After Authentication:**
   - The user is redirected to the appropriate environment's home page
   - All authentication state is properly maintained

## Configuration Requirements

For this to work properly:

1. **Supabase Project Configuration:**
   - Site URL: Your production URL (e.g., `https://www.hootai.am`)
   - Redirect URLs: Both localhost and production URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/login-callback` and `https://www.hootai.am/auth/login-callback`)

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Set to `http://localhost:3000` for development and your production URL for production
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
